Introductory Tutorial
======================

This tutorial will illustrate how to use :code:`PauLie` to classify the dynamical Lie algebra of a circuit given
the generators consisting of Paulistrings.
A Paulistring is a tensor product of Pauli matrices
.. math::
  \bigotimes_i  \sigma_i \, \sigma_i \in \{I,X,Y,Z\}
and is represented as a string indicating the Pauli matrices successively.
